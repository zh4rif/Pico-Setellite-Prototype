Define Requirements: Understand the specific requirements for data acquisition and environmental analytics in pico satellite systems. Consider factors such as sensor types, data transmission protocols, power constraints, and computational capabilities.

Sensor Selection: Choose appropriate sensors based on the environmental parameters you want to monitor. This could include sensors for measuring temperature, humidity, radiation levels, atmospheric pressure, and more.

## Data Acquisition System: 
Design and implement a data acquisition system that can interface with the selected sensors, collect data at regular intervals, and store or transmit it as needed. This system may include analog-to-digital converters, microcontrollers, and memory/storage components.

Onboard Processing: 
Determine whether onboard processing is necessary for real-time analysis or if raw data can be transmitted to ground stations for processing. If onboard processing is required, select suitable algorithms and implement them on the satellite's computational platform.

Communication Subsystem: 
Develop a communication subsystem to transmit data from the satellite to ground stations. This may involve selecting appropriate communication protocols, antennas, and transceiver hardware.

Power Management: 
Implement power management systems to efficiently utilize the limited power available on the satellite. This may include energy harvesting techniques, power regulation circuits, and low-power standby modes.

Environmental Analytics Algorithms: 
Develop algorithms for analyzing the collected data to extract meaningful insights about the satellite's environment. This could involve techniques such as data fusion, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling.

Integration and Testing: 
Integrate all components into a prototype satellite system and thoroughly test its functionality in simulated or real-world conditions. This includes testing sensor accuracy, communication reliability, power consumption, and overall system performance.

Validation and Iteration: 
Validate the prototype against the initial requirements and make any necessary iterations or improvements based on feedback. This may involve additional testing, refinement of algorithms, or hardware modifications.

Documentation and Deployment: 
Document the design, implementation, and testing process thoroughly to facilitate future development and deployment. Prepare the prototype for potential deployment in actual pico satellite missions.
